## Particle Filter based Tracker for Geospatial Tracking

-	Engineered a robust Bayesian particle filter to track objects within a challenging real-world geospatial dataset from a distributed camera network, successfully overcoming issues of non-linear motion, sensor noise, and intermittent detections.
-	Developed a Differentiable Particle Filter with soft resampling and reparameterization to enable an end-to-end, data-driven learning framework for diverse vehicle motion behaviors observed in the dataset.
-	Addressed non-linear object motion and high sensor noise by integrating a physics-based Constant Turn Rate and Velocity (CTRV) model, ensuring robust tracking despite frequent missed detections.
-	Mitigated severe particle degeneracy by implementing an Auxiliary Particle Filter (APF), which doubled the effective sample size (100% average increase) over a standard Bootstrap Filter and significantly enhanced tracker stability.
